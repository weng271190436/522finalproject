1. Modify inotify_init, inotify_add_watch, and related inotify syscalls
so that inotify can recursively watch all sub-directories. Specifically,
we want to add some of the functionality of fanotify system to inotify.
Fanotify allows recursive watches but is restrained in several ways to make
inotify irreplaceable, and we are trying to add some of the advantages of 
fanotify to inotify to make it better.

2. Currently, if we want to monitor the sub-directories, we need to add
a separate watch for each sub-directory. We want to modify inotify to
allow it to monitor a directory and all its sub-directories at once.

3. fs/notify/inotify/inotify_user.c
fs/notify/inotify/inotify.h
fs/notify/inotify/inotify_fsnotify.c

4. inotify_event in uapi/linux/inotify.h

5. None.

6. Add a watch to a directory with one sub-directory. Check if creating,
moving, copying files from or to the sub-directory can be detected by
inotify.

7. All will be written in C.

8. Week 1: figure out how inotify works.
Week 2: design our approach.
Week 3: implement.
Week 4: evaluation.
Week 5: presentation and writeup.
